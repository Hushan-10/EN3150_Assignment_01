# EN3150 Assignment 01 â€“ Learning from Data and Linear Models for Regression  

This repository contains solutions and Python implementations for **EN3150 Assignment 01** of the **B.Sc. Engineering (Semester 05)** program at the **University of Moratuwa**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Contents  
1. **Linear Regression & Outliers**  
   - Built regression models using the Normal Equation and `numpy.polyfit`.  
   - Compared candidate models under **robust loss functions** to handle outliers.  

2. **Loss Functions (MSE vs BCE)**  
   - Derived and plotted **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)**.  
   - Justified correct use cases:  
     - MSE â†’ for regression (continuous outcomes).  
     - BCE â†’ for binary classification (probabilistic outcomes).  

3. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling**  
   - Generated **sparse signals** and **Gaussian noise features**.  
   - Applied scaling methods using `scikit-learn`:  
     - `StandardScaler`  
     - `MinMaxScaler`  
     - `MaxAbsScaler`  
   - Chosen best scaling approach for each feature type with reasoning.  

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** â€“ numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ preprocessing & scaling  


âœ¨ *This repo demonstrates the use of linear models, robust estimators, and preprocessing techniques to effectively learn from data while addressing challenges such as outliers and feature scaling.*
